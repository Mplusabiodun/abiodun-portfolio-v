        work out In life, people will HURT you and go free, donâ€™t sit and hope
        things will happen to them rather put yourself together and strive
        harder. GOD is for everyone â˜¯ Background could only make things not
        easy, not impossible. Tell me how uneasy it was Iâ€™ll listen but not why

        REAL price Well, Hope is never something you should rely on. While
        waiting for the best, prepare for the worst Champ A man has to do what
        he has to do, whatever it takes If itâ€™s meant for everyone, it would
        have been easy, keep your head ðŸ†™ champ "Coding: where imagination meets
