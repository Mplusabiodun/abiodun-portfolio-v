      <p>
        A National Diploma Distinction holder and currently Civil Engineering
        student at Federal University of Technology Minna, Nger State. A
        FRONT-END DEVELOPER with great enthusiasm for building user centric
        software products. I started this journey to explore my passion for
        writing codes and solving complex software problems. Trust me it was
        indeed amazing writing my first HTML code ('Hello World') and being able
        to display on the screen.
